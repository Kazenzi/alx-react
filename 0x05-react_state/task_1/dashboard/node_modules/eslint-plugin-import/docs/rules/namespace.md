Enforces names exist at the time they are dereferenced, when imported as a full namespace (i.e. `import * as foo from './foo'; foo.bar();` will report if `bar` is not exported by `./foo`.).

Will report at the import declaration if there are _no_ exported names found.

Also, will report for computed references (i.e. `foo["bar"]()`).

Reports on assignment to a member of an imported namespace.

Note: for packages, the plugin will find exported names
from [`jsnext:main`], if present in `package.json`.
Redux's npm module includes this key, and thereby is lintable, for example.

A module path that is [ignored] or not [unambiguously an ES module] will not be reported when imported.
